# Antea25

This is test GitHub project **Antea25** for my experimental electronic project. 
Technologies involved are:
+ microcontroller 16F1709
+ compiler XC8 for microchip
+ RFID RC522
+ accelerometer ADXL365
+ OLED LCD 128*64
+ and programming language C.

I am absolute amateur in this area and purpose of this project is purely self-educational. But I do enjoy experimenting with technology and building things.
